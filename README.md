# DyGCN-AC-LSTM — fair-comparison pipeline for network traffic-matrix prediction

**Finding (see RESULTS.md):** When a static-graph baseline (DCRNN) is tuned on the
same budget, it matches or beats the proposed dynamic-graph model (DyGCN-AC-LSTM)
on two real backbones (Abilene, GEANT). The dynamic-graph advantage reported in the
original manuscript was an artifact of an untuned baseline. This repo is the clean,
open pipeline behind that honest comparison.

# DyGCN-AC-LSTM — clean-room rebuild

Rebuild of the network traffic-matrix prediction model from the manuscript, from
scratch, in a proper repo so results are reproducible. Original code was lost; this
regenerates it honestly rather than reusing unverifiable numbers.

## What runs today
- **Synthetic GÉANT-like benchmark** (no download) — generate data, train, evaluate.
- **Full model** DyGCN-AC-LSTM + **temporal baselines** LSTM and AC-LSTM.
- End-to-end: synthetic data → FCM+WES preprocessing → causal dynamic dCor adjacency
  → clockwork diffusion-gated encoder/decoder → metrics.

## Quick start (Colab or any machine with Python 3.10+)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt        # torch installs cleanly here
python smoke_test.py                   # ~1-2 min, proves the pipeline runs
python run_experiment.py               # multi-seed synthetic benchmark table
```
If `smoke_test.py` prints "SMOKE TEST PASSED", the pipeline is working. If it throws,
paste the full traceback back and it gets fixed fast.

## Design decision that resolves the reviewer's ambiguity
**Graph vertices = OD flows.** The adjacency Â_t has shape **[F, F]** where F is the
number of directed OD flows (30 for 6 nodes, 110 for Abilene's 11, 506 for GÉANT's 23).
Every module uses this definition. Consequence: the O(N²·W) adjacency cost is in
**N = flows**, not routers — so the manuscript's compute section must be rewritten in
terms of flows if you keep this choice. To switch to a router-level graph instead,
change only the feature that feeds `adjacency.py` (aggregate flows→routers) and the
shape becomes [N_routers, N_routers]; nothing else changes.

## What was tested vs. what you must smoke-test
- **Tested here (NumPy core, all passing):** synthetic generator; FCM (verified crisp
  on separable data) + WES; distance-correlation adjacency (dCor=1 for identical/negated,
  ~0 for independent; symmetric; spectral radius ≤ 1); metrics; non-overlapping windows.
- **Written + syntax-checked, run it yourself:** the PyTorch model, baselines, and
  training loop. torch could not be installed in the build sandbox (CUDA/disk), so the
  smoke test is your first execution. This is expected — run it on Colab.

## Corrections already baked in (from the two reviews)
- **WES direction:** standard EWMA `s_t = α·x_t + (1-α)·s_{t-1}` — higher α = LESS
  smoothing. The manuscript's "higher α ⇒ more aggressive smoothing" is the opposite;
  code + docstring state the correct interpretation. Flip the α-map if you meant the
  other behaviour, and fix the paper text to match.
- **FCM feature:** clustering the raw high-dim noisy series degenerates (curse of
  dimensionality). We cluster on interpretable per-flow shape features (burstiness,
  diurnal energy, lag-1 autocorrelation) — robust and non-degenerate. Document this in
  Methods (it's a deviation from "cluster the time series").
- **Causality:** adjacency at forecast origin t uses window strictly before t; decoder
  reuses the most recent cached matrix (≤ t). No future data enters.
- **Independent unit for significance:** windows are non-overlapping; use per-window
  MSE as the Wilcoxon unit (`metrics.paired_wilcoxon`), not every element.
- **Clockwork compute:** active-update fraction for periods {1,2,4,8} is
  (1+½+¼+⅛)/4 ≈ 0.47 (~53% fewer cell updates), an operation count — report measured
  wall-clock separately (it's higher than plain LSTM due to graph cost).

## Roadmap (next chunks, in order)
1. **Real datasets** — Abilene + GÉANT Totem loaders (map their TM files into `[T, F]`),
   swap `generate_geant_like` for a loader. Same pipeline downstream.
2. **Graph baselines** — wrap reference STGCN / DCRNN / Graph WaveNet, tuned on val.
3. **Transformer baseline** — encoder-decoder forecaster under the same protocol.
4. **Tuning harness** — equal budget, frozen test set, search spaces logged.
5. **Ablations** — Variant A–D (static adj / linear gates / no-FCM / uniform clock),
   plus the novelty-isolating (a)-(d) matched ablation and graph-construction robustness.
6. **Adjacency-evolution analysis** — snapshots, change-rate, shuffled-graph control.

## Stage 1: Abilene real data (NEW)

`src/abilene.py` + `run_abilene.py` load the real Abilene TM dataset through the
exact same tested pipeline as the synthetic run.

**Get the data.** Download the Abilene traffic-matrix dataset (Yin Zhang's
"Abilene-TM": weekly files `X01`..`X24`, 5-min sampling, 2016 rows/week). It also
ships in the R `networkTomography` package as a clean OD matrix, and several public
mirrors host it as `.mat`/`.csv`. Any of these work — the loader auto-detects layout.

**Always inspect before training** (confirms the detected shape so you don't train
on a mis-parsed file):
```bash
python -m src.abilene --path /path/to/abilene --inspect
# add --values-per-flow 5 if each flow has 5 measurement columns (Yin Zhang format)
# add --drop-node K to reproduce the 11-node / 110-flow variant in the paper
```
Expected for the 12-node data: N=12, F=132 (or F=110 with one node dropped).

**Run the benchmark** (the DDPM-TME CSVs are confirmed working):
```bash
# Abilene -> 11 nodes / 110 flows (matches the paper). Start with a subset + 1 seed:
python run_abilene.py --path Abilene_TM.csv --drop-node 0 --sample-min 5 \
    --max-steps 6048 --seeds 42 --log-transform

# GEANT -> 23 nodes / 506 flows. 15-min sampling; keep all flows:
python run_abilene.py --path Geant_TM.csv --sample-min 15 --min-active-frac 0 \
    --max-steps 6000 --seeds 42 --log-transform
```
Scale up (`--max-steps` larger, `--seeds 42 123 456 789 1024`) once a subset run looks right.
Prints per-seed and mean±std RMSE for LSTM, AC-LSTM, DyGCN-AC-LSTM on real data.

Notes / honesty:
- **Node count:** classic Abilene = 12 nodes. The paper claims 11 nodes / 110 flows.
  Decide which, use `--drop-node` if 11, and state N consistently in the paper.
- The loader was tested on synthetic files matching each supported layout (full
  matrix, off-diagonal, multi-column, node-drop, dead-flow filter, multi-week
  concat). Its first run on the *real* file is yours — `--inspect` first; if the
  shape looks wrong, paste the inspect output and we adjust the format flags.
- Graph baselines (STGCN/DCRNN/GWN) and the Transformer are still Stage 2/3.
